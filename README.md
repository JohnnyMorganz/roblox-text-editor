# Roblox Text Editor
A plugin for editing Text fields for TextLabels/Buttons/Boxes in Roblox Studio

Are you making some UI involving Text? You must've felt constricted to that tiny little input field in the properties field, making it really hard to work and check what you're typing.

To solve this, check out the Text Editor plugin!
Now you can edit your text quickly and easily, especially helpful with the introduction of Rich Text.

## Features
- Real time output window so you can see how your text will look as you type it
- Multi-line support for all text fields
- Toggles for rich text features, allowing you to easily highlight text and apply a rich text property to it (and remove it if already present!). If you toggle when not highlighting anything, it will add new tags at your cursor location, and move your cursor inside of them

## Getting Started
Simple! Just [install the plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/5402211369/Text-Editor), select a TextLabel/TextButton/TextBox, and open up the Text Editor!
To make editing **even quicker**, you can assign a Studio Shortcut (`FILE > Advanced > Customize Shortcuts` and look for `Text Editor: Toggle Open`) to an easy keybind, so you can quickly open/close the Text Editor when you need it
